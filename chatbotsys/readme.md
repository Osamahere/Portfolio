# Advanced Mobile Product Analysis and Interactive Chatbot System

## Overview:

Welcome to the Advanced Mobile Product Analysis and Interactive Chatbot System! This project is designed as a Level 1 chatbot implemented in Python, with a primary focus on mobile product analysis. Leveraging Python functions, the chatbot fetches data from a provided dataset in CSV format.

## Project Components:

### 1. App.py:
The core of the system lies in the `App.py` file, where Python coding is implemented to process user queries, interact with the dataset, and provide insightful responses.

### 2. Frontend:
The project features a user-friendly interface created using Flask. The frontend includes the following directories:

- **Templates:** This directory holds HTML templates for rendering dynamic content.
- **Static:** Static assets such as CSS and images reside here.

## Features:

- **Mobile Product Analysis:** The chatbot utilizes Python functions to analyze mobile product data from the provided CSV dataset.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can engage with the chatbot through a responsive and interactive chat interface.

## How It Works:

1. Users input queries related to mobile products.
2. The chatbot processes the queries using Python functions.
3. Data is fetched from the dataset to provide informative responses.
4. The Flask frontend renders the chat interface dynamically.
